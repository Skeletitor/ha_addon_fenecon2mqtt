Thanks for all the love youâ€™ve shown Fenecon2MQTT over the years. 

Itâ€™s been a wild ride, but itâ€™s time for this add-on to retire and let [HA-OpenEMS](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/ha-openems-fems-and-openems-integration/852706) take the spotlight. Letâ€™s raise a virtual toast to new beginnings! ðŸ¥‚

---

This add-on connects to Fenecon Home (FEMS) websocket and subscribes to the configured channels. This data is pushed to Hassio integrated mqtt broker. All sensors(entities) are added autmatically.

Thanks goes to [@benniju] who gives the idea of using websocket.
